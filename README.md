## Todo App with Reactjs
Todo App literally does what the name means. I have developed the app initially using vanilla javascript but i decided to develop another one using Reactjs. Reactjs is a javascript libraries that handle UI pretty well. Developing this app using Reactjs was really simple than doing it in vanila javascript. It allows me to add more feature compare to the one developed with vanila javascript. Features like edit feature, delete feature. 


## Programming language used

1. HTML

2. CSS

3. Reactjs

4. Redux
